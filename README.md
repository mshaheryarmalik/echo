### ForestEcho: Empowering decisions with the echoes of our forests, one sustainable action at a time. üå≤

Imagine a world where we could protect forests more effectively, potentially saving **100 million trees every year**. This vision is closer to reality with **ForestEcho**‚Äîa platform that uses satellite data and AI to monitor forest health, empowering decision-makers to take timely, informed actions.

Forests are disappearing at an alarming rate. In **2022**, we lost **9.9 billion trees**, the forest impacts **80% of land-based species** and contributes to **30% of global carbon impact**. Amidst this crisis, ForestEcho provides crucial insights, aiming to reduce deforestation by **5-10%** each year.

### How ForestEcho Works

ForestEcho combines advanced technology with intuitive features to deliver real-time forest insights:

1. **Interactive Map**: Users explore locations on an interactive map and request health reports for specific regions.

2. **AI-Powered Analysis**: 
   - **Vision Transformer Model**: Processes satellite images to identify and categorize forested areas.
   - **Forest Health Classification**: Goes beyond simple labels, highlighting ‚Äúprimary‚Äù (healthy) areas and flagging concerns like haze, water encroachment, and infrastructure impacts.

3. **Forest Health Reporting**: ForestEcho generates detailed reports within seconds, summarizing forest health, environmental stressors, and recommendations based on recent satellite data.
